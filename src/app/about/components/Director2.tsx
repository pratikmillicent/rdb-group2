                      Founded in 2017 by industry veterans Anuj Puri and Rohin
                      Shah, ANAROCK is a people-first company.

                      The roots of the company lie in the shared passion between
                      Anuj and Rohin for bringing order to a highly disorganised
                      Real Estate sector. The journey started in 1993 when they
                      discussed reimagining the Real Estate space with new ways
                      of working. Their shared ethics and values laid the
                      foundation of ANAROCK’s value-oriented culture with a
                      clear focus on bringing about transparency in the Real
                      Estate sector. The idea was to deliver more than just
                      properties, it was about delivering solutions. The roadmap
                      was to boost transparency and improve communication
                      between all stakeholders in the Real Estate industry. This
                      would eventually lead to more informed decision-making.
                      Since the early days, they have been working towards this
                      broader goal.

                      Having successfully predicted the real estate boom in
                      India that has been evident for the last few years, Anuj
                      and Rohin launched ANAROCK based on this belief and scaled
                      it up to branch across different value propositions in
                      Real Estate.
